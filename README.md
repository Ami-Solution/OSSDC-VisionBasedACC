# OSSDC-VisionBasedACC
Discuss requirments and develop code for #1-mvp-vbacc MVP (see also this channel on ossdc.org Slack)

We have a few initial demos videos here, showing how detection/tracking/segmentation/depth estimation algoritms can be used:

- ### An initial demo with Mask R-CNN (for object detection and instance segmentation) in Google Colaboratory with GPU acceleration (see more demos bellow):
  - ### https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionBasedACC/blob/master/image-segmentation/ossdc_matterport_Mask_RCNN_colaboratory.ipynb

- ### An initial demo with SfMLearner (for depth and ego-motion estimation from monocular videos) in Google Colaboratory with GPU acceleration:
  - ### https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionBasedACC/blob/master/object_detection/SfMLearner_demo.ipynb

- ### Super cool! Now we can run this for free in the cloud with GPU acceleration at about 15FPS on 720p Youtube video, try this IPython example in Google Colaboratory, updated with live streaming of processed output to ffplay:
  - ### https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionBasedACC/blob/master/object_detection/ossdc_vbacc_object_detection_notebook_colaboratory.ipynb
- ### Update demo code is here (see run demo scripts):
  - ### https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionBasedACC/tree/master/object_detection 

- [SSD Tensorflow based car detection and tracking demo for OSSDC.org VisionBasedACC PS3/PS4 simulator ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqnjHqwP68Y)
  - The code for the demo is here (see ossdc scripts): 
    - https://github.com/OSSDC/SSD-Tensorflow/tree/master/notebooks
  - It can ran in real time on local videos or network streams, including directly on YouTube videos (using youtube-dl program), like I described here:
    - https://github.com/OSSDC/SSD-Tensorflow/commit/26fa7eea5155ac3989476936628e62be3d773b95

- [Real time YOLO detection in OSSDC Simulator running TheCrew on PS4 30fps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANgDlNfDoAQ)
  - The code for the demo is here: 
    - https://github.com/OSSDC/darknet
  - See here instructions on how to run it:
    - https://github.com/OSSDC/darknet/commit/dc76e5690c753ce093417e096313b390b5d5c2ae

It can be noted in the videos above that SSD Tensorflow is more accurate than the Yolo version.
